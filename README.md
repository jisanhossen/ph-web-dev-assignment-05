React Questions
1. What is JSX and why is it used? HTML-like syntax inside JS. Easier to read/write than React.createElement().

2. Props vs state? Props come from the parent and can't be changed. State is a component's own data that can change.

3. What does useState do, and where did you use it? Stores a value and re-renders on change. Used for myStack, loading, and the mobile menu toggle.

4. What does useEffect do, and why for the JSON data? Runs code after render (side effects). Needed so the JSON loads once, not on every render.

5. Why does .map() need a unique key? So React can track each item correctly between re-renders. Used tech.id.

6. What is conditional rendering? Give an example. Showing different UI based on a condition — e.g. "Your stack is empty" when myStack.length === 0.

7. How does parent-child data flow work? Parent → child via props. Child → parent by calling a function passed down as a prop.
